# Retail-Orders-Data-Pipeline
Retail Orders Data Pipeline, Analysis and  Visualization using Python, SQL and Tableau
This repository contains an analysis of data on retail orders. The objective of this project is to build a data pipeline that extracts & transforms data on retail orders for a stationery store then load it to a SQL server for analysis and visualize the key parameters on a dashboard in Tableau.
The dataset used in this repository is found on kaggle. Visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ankitbansal06/retail-orders for more information.
The notebook contains all the processes.
For the sql queries there is a 'retail_orders.sql' file in the repository.
The tableau dashboard info is on the 'Dashboard Pic.pdf', more info https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prosper.masakara/viz/RetailOrdersDashboard/Dashboard_Retail_Orders.
